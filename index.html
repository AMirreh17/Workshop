									<h2>User Experience</h2>
									<p>User Experience (UX) is the principle of designing a website or web application for a specific user
										group.</p>

								<!--Additional text can be placed within the text element below-->
								
								<!-- Place your text here-->
								<p class="content">This principle can be executed through different UX design processes such as The Five Planes of UX
									Design. These processes help designers and developers to understand what their potential users are
									looking for and how to complete the website at hand efficiently. As a result, better websites and
									applications are made.

									Also, other aspects of UX design are essential such as User Research and User Testing. User Research
									is the process of collecting data from your intended user group. This consists of completing
									interviews, observations, surveys and focus groups. User Testing is the process of testing your design
									or prototype website with the intended user group after completing User Research.</p>

									<h2>Prototype Design</h2>
									<p>During the User Research/User Testing phase of a web project, the process of designing a website begins. The design stage is very pivotal when creating a website as the final layout is decided at this stage of a project</p>

								<p class="content">
									This process follows the results of User Research such as user expectations. 
									There are various stages when designing a website, for example, Low-Fidelity (a sketch version of a website), Mid-Fidelity (a basic layout design of a website) and High-Fidelity (the final design of a website, ready for development). 
									Each stage is completed at different periods of time within a project and once the High-Fidelity version is completed, this is then given to the development team for coding.  
									Popular apps used for designing websites are Figma, Adobe InDesign, Adobe XD, Sketch and many more. These design apps are used by industry professionals to design websites and mobile applications.</p>
